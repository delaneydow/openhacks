# openhacks

This project is for the OpenHacks hacakthon, taking place on 05/23/2020 - 05/24/2020. The goal of our project is to tackle the problem of the year; the covid-19 pandemic. We are using sourced data, various epidemiological models, and user input to predict various outputs for the user specific to their exposure, severity, and rate of testing in regards to covid-19 in the hopes that this algorithm will help to keep people safer. 

The project's premise is a library written in C++, with an example program that can be used to implement the library.

The main contributers of this project are Michael Howes, Hannah Collins, and Delaney Dow, who are rising juniors at Boston University's College of Engineering.
